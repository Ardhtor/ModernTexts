Practice
--

Practice is effort towards completion. Man finds effort in practice his method, his 'illo tempore--' his continual state. 
To say that Man is ritualistic is to say his approach is repeated. 

'Analysis' is the study of practice. To fashion a schematic for improvement-- one must be aware. This too is
practiced: so then man must practice, and study how he practices, and study how he studies, and so on and so forth. To approach any action with intention 
necessitates this awareness. 

'Meta-Analysis' is something of the above stacked upon itself. 'Meta-Analysis' is examination of examination- analysis of analysis. An editor who looks through
documents to notice similarities in order to give those documents a title conducts 'Meta-Analysis.' Those factors that represent common analyses are included in
one's 'Meta-Analysis.'

Within Man's 'Meta-Analysis' is his conclusions. These conclusions take many shapes; his observations about the best sounding names, the way to grill steak 
with garlic to make it taste best, how nature manifests itself in fractals. Man makes judgements about his observations across his narratives.

These truths are often expressed as universals. Universals, or 'Meta-Narratives,' give testimony about truths everywhere in the Universe. Lyotard expresses his 
critique of Modern 'Meta-Narratives,' in his 'Incredulite:'-- Newtonian physics and Enlightenment era particle geometry were situated ideas, arising from local 
subjectivities in 18th century Europe. Lyotard argues these Platonistic assumptions about being were moored to the technology of that time. The Postmodern Critique
as 'An Incredulity for Metanarratives' challenges Western Epistemology, its underlying paradigms.

Followed through, the Postmodern Critique leaves us with little. Yet what is cleft does not disembody: it performs. To speak before the stars is to
talk to an audience. All is clear in the sight of heaven. So there is substance to the critique. 

A web of subjectivity, a 'Panopticon' as Foucault has put it, renders the most powerful as the arbiters of truth. Yet truth is produced; philosophers concede truth
is 'reified;' created. History is Material; Material is mutable.

To hide an idea is to conceal it. I argue to conceal is the entire event. Those who worship abandon themselves to their object. Self Abandonment, or 'ego death,' is the devotee's
'axis mundi,' the point upon which their worship turns. Relinquishment of the self allows access into the inexpressable, where worship occurs.
 It is to say the revelation occurs in a realm where the self is non-essential. 

What deliniates worship from its object is its inexpressability. It cannot be uttered, lest the event be made profane.  Phenomenological experience is ineffable-- to utter it betrays its substance. If its expression is uttered, then the experience 
is profaned.  And if it is not sacred then it needs not be sacralized. It is then not above criticism, doubt.
